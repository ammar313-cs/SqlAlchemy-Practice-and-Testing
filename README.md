# SqlAlchemy-Practice-and-Testing
// Learning SqlAlchemy ORM 2.0 for Database Mapping for my S.E role at my compnay 
## Note: This was my initial code for learning the ORM, since this commit I have went on to building a fully functional sqlaclchemy backend for the compnay I am working for. Since this initial codebase, I have successfully:
Built a fully functional SQLAlchemy backend for my company.
Developed and refined a Python-based ETL pipeline, which has been integrated into our system and optimized for performance.
Utilized these skills to handle complex database operations and data transformation needs for our projects.
## Reflection
This initial code served as the foundation for my SQLAlchemy expertise. It highlights the importance of hands-on practice and iterative learning when tackling new technologies. From these humble beginnings, Iâ€™ve progressed to delivering impactful solutions at scale.
